![ER Diagram](https://github.com/elenatis/portfolio/blob/master/SQL/flights_db_ER_DIAGRAM.png)
At flights_db_scripts.sql file among others there such queries as 
* Which cities don't have direct flights between them.
* On which routes passengers have to make transfers, considering transfer as less tham 24 hours between arrival and departure.
* Distance estimating between departure city and  city of arrival

## Telecom Data
Dataset is available at [Telecom Data Cup sandbox](https://mlbootcamp.ru/ru/round/15/sandbox/)
At telecom_db_scripts.sql file among others I show a query, calculating Cumulative Sum and Rolling Average in one row, using window functions.
